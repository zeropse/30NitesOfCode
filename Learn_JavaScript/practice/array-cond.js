Next, write a conditional statement with the following logic:

If our characters array includes an element with the value "Waldo", do this:
Save the index of the "Waldo" element in a new variable called waldoIndex.
Then use console.log() to display "Found Waldo at index {indexNumber}!" (e.g., "Found Waldo at index 3").
Else, log "Not found" to the Console.
